# 1 while loop
# Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is TRUE. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.

# 2	for loop
# Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.

# 3	nested loops
# You can use one or more loop inside any another while, for or do..while loop.
